# ProgressBarInterface

This code is a Python script that creates a graphical user interface (GUI) with a progress bar using the tkinter module.

The first line, # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-, specifies the encoding of the script. It tells the interpreter that the script is written in the Unicode UTF-8 encoding, which is a widely used character encoding that can represent characters from most languages.

The lines between the triple quotes (""") are comments that provide information about the script, such as its title and the name of the person who wrote it.

The line # !/usr/bin/env python3 is called a shebang, and it specifies the path to the Python interpreter that should be used to execute the script. The line # Python version : 3.8 specifies the version of Python that the script was written for.

The following lines import various modules that are needed for the script to work. The tkinter module provides functions and classes for creating a GUI, and the messagebox module provides functions for displaying message boxes. The ttk module is a submodule of tkinter that provides themed widgets, and the init module is a custom module that is not part of the Python standard library.

The ProgressBar class is a subclass of the Toplevel class, which is a class provided by tkinter that represents a top-level window. The __init__ method is the constructor of the class, and it is called when a new instance of the class is created.

The __init__ method sets the title and icon of the window, as well as its size and position on the screen. It also sets the window to be non-resizable and registers a method to be called when the user tries to close the window.

The __init__ method also creates a progress bar and a label widget and places them in the window using the grid geometry manager provided by tkinter. The progress bar has a fixed length and is horizontally oriented, and the label displays the current progress as a percentage.

The __on_closing__ method is called when the user tries to close the window, and it displays a message box asking the user to confirm the action. If the user confirms, the window is closed; otherwise, the window stays open.

The __update_progress_label__ method updates the text of the label widget to show the current progress as a percentage.

The progress method takes any number of integer arguments and updates the progress bar with a percentage value calculated based on the number of arguments. For example, if the method is called with the arguments (10, 5), the progress bar will increase by 50% (10/5 * 100).

The get_value and set_value methods are getter and setter methods that allow the user to get or set the value of the progress bar.

The __str__ method returns a string representation of the progress bar, which can be used for debugging or for printing the object to the console.
